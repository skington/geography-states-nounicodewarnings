	[Documentation]
		Updated the documentation to clarify that warnings aren't a problem
		on many systems, and apparently not on modern Perls.

	[Bugfix]
		Geography::States doesn't warn on all systems. I can't reproduce
		this easily - it's not just a matter of locales - and it's not
		important that it used to warn; what's important is that it
		doesn't now.
